🎯 Excited to share my latest contribution to the developer community!

I've created an Enhanced Azure DevOps MCP Server that addresses a critical gap in VS Code integration. This is the first MCP server to support Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication for Azure DevOps, providing enterprise-grade security.

🔑 Key Features:
• Personal Access Token authentication (industry first)
• 50+ integrated tools covering all Azure DevOps areas
• Multiple authentication modes (OAuth, CLI, Environment, PAT)
• 98% test coverage with comprehensive security guidelines
• Production-ready with TypeScript type safety

This server enhances productivity for Azure DevOps teams by providing secure, comprehensive automation directly in VS Code through GitHub Copilot.
